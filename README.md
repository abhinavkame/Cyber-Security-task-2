# Cyber-Security-task-2

1) support@secure-paypl.com – looks like PayPal but it's fake (paypl instead of paypal
2) "Urgent", "Your account will be locked", "within 24 hours" – creates panic
3) URL says "PayPal", but links to secure-paypl.com, which is suspicious
4) The link does not point to paypal.com, a trusted domain
5) security_form.html – can run malicious scripts or trick user into entering credentials
6) The message mimics urgency and fear, a typical sign of phishing
